# Remaster project

New features:
1. Countdown Timer (If you run out of time it cancels the time-trial.)
2. Fuelpump Placement (For the RP servers, should help for custom ymaps)
3. More Config Options (Blip settings, initial countdown time, countdown multiplier)
4. Slight HUD refresh (all on screen timers and score displays converted from Seconds to Minutes:Seconds)


Starting with the QBCore framework the following plans for this remaster:
1. Full QB integration (IN PROGRESS: Notifications and basic money payout currently)
2. Re-color/re-work HUD
3. Item based (option to require item) item opens NUI menu to show players, tracks, and scores
4. Variable payout based on length of track, time remaining, 1st place, etc.
5. Class based leaderboards (TBA)
6. and more?
